Toshiba Corporation, a global technology leader, faced significant challenges in managing their open-source software (OSS) components. With a vast number of software components used across various projects, they needed a robust solution to:

- Centralize the management of OSS-related data
- Ensure compliance with software licenses and security policies
- Track vulnerabilities and maintain an accurate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Improve collaboration between departments handling OSS components
---
## The Solution
---
Toshiba implemented **SW360** as their primary OSS management platform. The deployment included:

- Integration with their existing development tools and workflows
- Customization of SW360 to enhance dependency management and SBOM tracking
- Training of teams across various departments
- Establishment of clear guidelines and processes for OSS component management

---
## Key Benefits
